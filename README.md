## Concept

Ever had a family night in with nothing to do? Quizicle comes to the rescue. This fun react application allows users to sign up, login and create quizzes from a host of different categories and difficulties. The questions are generated and rendered through a third party API

## User Story

```
AS A USER i want to be able to sign up
SO THAT i can create my own profile

I WANT to be able to login
SO THAT i can track my progress of the quizzes i have created

WHEN I LOGIN
THEN i am directed to the dashboard page

WHEN I land on the dashboard page
THEN a create quiz button will appear

WHEN I create a quiz
THEN save my quiz in the database, so that i can view it later

WHEN I create multiple quizzes
THEN they are all shown in the dashboard page

WHEN you generate a quiz
THEN an overview of the quiz will be displayed

IF a user is unhappy with the quiz questions
THEN a button will allow to refetch new questions

WHEN a quiz is completed and user is happy
THEN then the quiz will be saved

WHEN I delete a quiz
THEN the quiz no longer shows up on my dashboard page

WHEN I logout
THEN my session is deleted



```

## Technologies

- Core files: JS, Node.JS, React.js, MongoDB

- Libraries: MUI, Google fonts, FontAwesome

## React.JS

The team used react to render and style the front end. Using react allowed the application to be developed dynamically to a very high standard.

We integrated MUI library for styling within the react file; allowing us to not to need a further CSS page. Being able to do the CSS alongside the development of the front-end saved the team time.

## Future developments

- Add trending quizzes feature on the homepage
- Update UI
- Allow other users to participate in quizzes
- Allow incoming friend requests
- Allow a quiz master to host quizzes
- Be able to send and receive quiz requests
